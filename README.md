## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was my first attempt at use of a media query. I seem to have successfully employed the @media rule with a max-width. My current understanding is this is a more desktop first approach. I plan to redo this challenge eventually with a mobile first approach to improve my skills in that area.


### Continued development

I need to continue working on proper use and execution of the media query. My next challenge or two, I want to use CSS grid instead of flexbox.
