## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
  - Flexbox
  - Media query


### What I learned

This is my first project to use a media query. The resources I have been learning from only briefly touched on how to use the @media rule in CSS. So Captain Google saved the day. I found the YouTube videos from Kevin Powell to be extremely helpful in deciding how I should approach the vertical version of the card.
